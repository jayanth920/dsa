1. Can exchange array elements using this for Python matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]. For JS [matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]]
2. The % n in the expression nums[(i + 1) % n] is used to wrap around the end of the array to the beginning, effectively handling the case where i + 1 would go out of bounds.
