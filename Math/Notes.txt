1. In prime number problems, 1 to sq(N), for loop for 1 to sq(N)+1(exclusive),if N divisible by i meaning  N%i is 0, then N//i is also a divisor.


2. Finding GCD or HCF.  (the common prime factors of both multiplied is hcf.) Link for better understanding of hcf or gcd. "https://byjus.com/maths/hcf/"
"    def gcd(x, y):
        while y != 0:
            (x, y) = (y, x % y)
        return x"



3. Finding LCM. Code is below. Formula using GCD is: |x * y| // gcd(x, y). 
" # CODE 1 - USING GCD
    def lcm(x, y):
        return abs(x * y) // gcd(x, y)"

"# CODE 2 - WITHOUT GCD
    def lcm(x, y):
        # Start from the maximum of x and y
        lcm = max(x, y)

        # Increment lcm by itself until it is divisible by both x and y
        while lcm % x != 0 or lcm % y != 0:
            lcm += max(x, y)

        return lcm"
